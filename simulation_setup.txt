Randomly generated network - vary the number of nodes 
Fix the reporter node -so  in this way the reporter node location also varies
We want to analyze the results of our method - namely if it can find the best 2,3 k node path in the network


Studying the path utility method in isolation ie. not inferring the network from the data
In ideal conditions assuming that the randomly generated network is the one that is used along with the path utility method

Simulation conditions:
	Best k node pathway
	 1. In the randomly generated network find all the k node paths P-1...P_p to the reporter node.
	2. For activation Start and the reporter node states are fixed at 1, while the others can vary S(+)....R(+)
		For inhibition Start and the reporter node states are fixed at 0, while the others can vary S(-)....R(-) 
		Now corresponding to each P_i path there would be multiple paths, let total number of these paths be N
	3. Out of these N paths randomly select one path to be the best path
		This path should be the most likely other should be less than this though in a random fashion
		Say N=4 then  (5 is the reporter node)
		X     P(X=x) 
		1	0.1 			8+   1+  5+
		2    0.2               8+   1-  5+ 
		3    0.5   best path2+ 9+ 5+
		4    0.2               2+   9-   5+
	Consider this as if instead of knocking out one gene we are knocking out k-1 genes or essentially fixing the values for these k-1 genes
	4. Generating the dataset 
		Let the number of genes be G, then 
		For each of the P_p paths fix the value for the k genes, the rest of the G-k gene values to be assigned randomly. 
		For each of the remaining G-k genes pick a random number b/w 0 to 1, let that be the proportion of ones for the variable

		the number of records for these P_p paths is in the ratio stated in pt 3.
		Say 200 records total
		100  with 5+
		 8+   1+  5+   10 records
		8+   1-  5+    20 records
		2+   9+  5+    50 records
		2+   9-  5+    10 records
		100 with 5-   all of these in any  proportion random
       	 8+   1+  5+   
		8+   1-  5+    
		2+   9+  5+    
		2+   9-  5+
